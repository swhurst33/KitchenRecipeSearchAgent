# Kitchnsync.io – Agent Context & Rules

## 🧠 Purpose
This agent is part of Kitchnsync.io — an AI-powered meal planning and grocery list tool. Its job is to:
- Accept a natural language recipe prompt (e.g., “quick keto dinner”)
- Extract meal intent and search real recipe websites
- Parse the recipe content into structured data (title, image, ingredients, instructions, macros)
- Compare ingredients against a user's pantry list stored in Supabase
- Return structured recipes (and optionally the missing grocery list)

## ✅ Must-Use Tools & Libraries
- Use **OpenAI GPT-4 API** for keyword/intent extraction
- Use **requests**, **BeautifulSoup**, or **recipe-scrapers** for fetching/parsing recipe content
- Use **Supabase** for:
  - Storing recipes (table: `recipes`)
  - Pulling pantry items (table: `pantry_items`)
- Use **FastAPI** or **Flask** for creating the API endpoint `/agent`

## 🚫 Do Not:
- Do not store raw HTML from pages — only structured fields
- Do not use Selenium or heavyweight scrapers unless explicitly allowed
- Do not return unstructured or unvalidated JSON to the frontend
